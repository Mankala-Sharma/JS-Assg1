    <p>Ques2:- What are the JavaScript Engines?</p>
    <p>Ans2:- JavaScript is a scripting language and is not directly understood by computer but the browsers have inbuilt JavaScript engine which help them to understand and interpret JavaScript codes. These engines help to convert our JavaScript program into computer-understandable language. 
        A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language.
